This plugin allows you to control a dome rotation and shutter with the NexDome Dome Rotation Kit (http://www.nexdome.com/#!product-page/gba22/79b04628-9935-5ea7-9c5b-6936abac9900 ) from NexDome (shutter control should be available soon too).
This was developed and tested using a "desk" dome (see picture on my website).

The NexDome Rotation Kit firmware can be found on Gerry Rozema's GitHub : https://github.com/grozzie2/NexDome

Pre-compiled versions for OS X, Windows, Unbuntu X86_64 and Rapsberry Pi Pixel can be found there :
